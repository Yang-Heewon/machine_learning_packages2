# machine_learning_packages2
## 1)Project tItle
### The best algorithms with best hyperparameters
## 2)Motivation
### To find the best algorithms and to find a best hyperparameter that could fit in the olivetti_faces_dataset! To have a better understanding how face recogniztion works in daily basis
## 3)Build status
### In my opinion there are no errors or bugs in my coding> If there's any error in my coding mail at heewon6205@naver.com
## 4)Code style
### Standard
## 5)Screenshots

## 6)Tech/Framework used
### Algorithms-Logistic Regression : Logistic Regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values. In this case there are also only two outcome /face recognition(Yes/No)
## 7)Features
### Hyperparameter: c = Inverse of regularization strength(weaken the regularzation) / max_iter = To try more gradint descent to have more accurate value of the weight value / random_state = To get the same accuracy
