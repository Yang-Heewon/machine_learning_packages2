# machine_learning_packages2
## 1)Project tItle
### The best algorithms with best hyperparameters
## 2)Motivation
### To find the best algorithms and to find a best hyperparameter that could fit in the olivetti_faces_dataset! To have a better understanding how face recogniztion works in daily basis
## 3)Build status
### 1.In my opinion there are no errors or bugs in my coding  
### 2.If there's any error in my coding mail at heewon6205@naver.com
## 4)Code style
### Standard
## 5)Screenshots

## 6)Tech/Framework used
### Algorithms-Logistic Regression : Logistic Regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values. In this case there are also only two outcome /face recognition(Yes/No)
## 7)Features
### 1.Hyperparameter: c = Inverse of regularization strength(weaken the regularzation, it gives high weight to the training data) 
### 2.max_iter = To try more gradint descent to have more accurate value of the weight value
### 3.random_state = To get the same accuracy
## 8)Code examples
### To use this code that in supervised learning -classification logistic could get the highest accuracy for olivetti faces dataset. This means that Logistic regression is a good method to recognize faces.
## 9)Installation
### sklearn(pip install sklearn) 
### matplotlib(pip install matplotlib)
## 10)How to use
### Use this code to check that logistic regression is a good way to recognize faces.
## 11) Addition
### We could use SVC algorithms also. This has good accuracy also! ![image](<img width="800" alt="캡처" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92854581/146935847-f7983ead-43fd-4fa3-acdf-c4a3162b9d21.PNG">
